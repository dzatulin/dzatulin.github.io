Hello! My name is Dmytro Zatulin, and I am a system administrator with 10 years of experience, primarily specializing in Linux technologies. For the past 4 years, I have been working as a DevOps engineer, focusing on automation, infrastructure management, and cloud technologies. I created this blog to document my technical skills and experiences working on various projects. From time to time, I revisit my old posts, which helps me solve current problems and challenges.
